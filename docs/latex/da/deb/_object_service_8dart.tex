A service class that fetches a list of \mbox{[}\doxylink{class_found_object}{Found\+Object}\mbox{]} instances from a remote API.

This class provides a method for fetching objects with filters, such as station name, object type, start date, end date, and sort order. It uses the \mbox{[}http\mbox{]} package to make HTTP requests to the remote API.
